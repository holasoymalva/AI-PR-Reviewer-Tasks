# 🔍 AI PR Reviewer Tasks 🤖

Welcome to **AI PR Reviewer Tasks**! This repository provides a collection of `.mdc` (Markdown Command) files designed to supercharge your Pull Request review process within the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) editor. Leverage AI to systematically analyze code changes, detect issues, suggest improvements, and ensure code quality before merging.

Transform your PR reviews from time-consuming manual tasks into efficient, thorough, and consistent quality checks!

## ✨ The Core Idea

Pull Request reviews are critical for code quality but can be inconsistent, time-consuming, and prone to human oversight. This toolkit aims to make PR reviews:

1. **Systematic:** Follow proven review patterns and best practices
2. **Comprehensive:** Cover security, performance, maintainability, and testing
3. **Consistent:** Apply the same rigorous standards across all reviews
4. **Educational:** Learn from AI suggestions and improve coding practices
5. **Efficient:** Reduce review time while increasing thoroughness
