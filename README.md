# 🔍 AI PR Reviewer Tasks 🤖

Welcome to **AI PR Reviewer Tasks**! This repository provides a collection of `.mdc` (Markdown Command) files designed to supercharge your Pull Request review process within the [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) editor. Leverage AI to systematically analyze code changes, detect issues, suggest improvements, and ensure code quality before merging.

Transform your PR reviews from time-consuming manual tasks into efficient, thorough, and consistent quality checks!

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- [Cursor Editor](https://cursor.sh/) installed
- Basic understanding of Pull Requests
- A GitHub/GitLab repository with code changes

### Your First Review
1. **Download** the `.mdc` files to your project (see [Installation](#-installation))
2. **Open Cursor** and navigate to your PR files
3. **Start simple:** `Use @analyze-pr-changes.mdc`
4. **Tag your files:** `@src/component.js @tests/test.js`
5. **Review results** and follow AI suggestions

### 👀 See It In Action

**Before using the toolkit:**
❌ "This code looks fine to me" *(misses 3 security issues)*

**After using the toolkit:**
✅ AI detects: SQL injection vulnerability in line 23  
✅ AI suggests: Use parameterized queries  
✅ AI proposes: 5 specific test cases for edge cases

## 📖 Key Concepts

**What is a Code Smell?** 🤔  
Code that works but is poorly written, hard to maintain, or follows bad practices.

**What are .mdc files?** 📝  
Markdown Command files that give specific instructions to AI about how to analyze your code.

**What is a PR Review?** 🔍  
The process of checking code changes before they're merged into the main codebase.

## ✨ The Core Idea

Pull Request reviews are critical for code quality but can be inconsistent, time-consuming, and prone to human oversight. This toolkit aims to make PR reviews:

1. **Systematic:** Follow proven review patterns and best practices
2. **Comprehensive:** Cover security, performance, maintainability, and testing
3. **Consistent:** Apply the same rigorous standards across all reviews
4. **Educational:** Learn from AI suggestions and improve coding practices
5. **Efficient:** Reduce review time while increasing thoroughness

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

### 🚀 Beginner Path: Start Simple

**Option A: Quick Health Check** *(2 minutes)*
```
Use @analyze-pr-changes.mdc
Review this file: @src/myfile.js
Focus on: security and basic quality
```

**Option B: One-Tool Focus** *(5 minutes)*
```
Use @detect-code-smells.mdc for @src/component.js
Focus on: readability and maintainability
```

### 🔍 Intermediate Path: Comprehensive Review

Perfect for important features or when you have more time:

**Step 1: Get the Big Picture**
```
Use @analyze-pr-changes.mdc
Review these changed files: @file1.js @file2.py @component.tsx
Context: [Brief description of the feature/fix]
```

**Step 2: Deep Dive on Quality**
```
Use @detect-code-smells.mdc for the files we just analyzed
Focus on: [performance, security, or maintainability]
```

**Step 3: Get Specific Suggestions**
```
Use @suggest-improvements.mdc based on the previous analysis
Prioritize: [high-impact changes, security fixes, or performance gains]
```

**Step 4: Ensure Proper Testing**
```
Use @propose-test-cases.mdc for the changed functionality
Include: [unit tests, integration tests, or specific test scenarios]
```

### 🎯 Specialized Workflows

**🚨 Security-Focused Review** *(For sensitive code)*
```
Use @analyze-pr-changes.mdc with security focus
Then @detect-code-smells.mdc emphasizing security patterns
```

**🧪 Test-First Review** *(For logic-heavy changes)*
```
Use @propose-test-cases.mdc first to understand test requirements
Then @analyze-pr-changes.mdc to verify implementation quality
```

**⚡ Performance Review** *(For optimization work)*
```
Use @analyze-pr-changes.mdc focusing on performance
Then @suggest-improvements.mdc for specific optimizations
```
